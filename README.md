### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cam, A passionate full-stack developer from the UK.

I just graduated from Le Wagon London.
I've just finished working on a group project called www.footsteps.world, and I'm now thinking about what to work on next. I have loads of ideas!
I'm still learning pretty much everything! Ruby on Rails, JavaScrip, SASS, HTML... And focusing on honing my skills by doing little projects every day.
I'm happy to collaborate on anything!
My pronouns are he/him.
